fitness and gym website 

Huan Fitness Centre was established in 2010 in Klang Valley. The centre offers a variety of services, including physical training and dietary consultation, with the mission of "bringing you to a healthier life for your beautiful future." The centre welcomes the public to sign up as members and participate in fitness classes offered for a monthly fee ranging from RM50 to RM100. Additionally, members can consult with a professional nutritionist at the centre for personalized dietary advice based on their body condition for a fee of RM20 per session.
Chen Huan, the owner of Huan Fitness Centre, is a supporter of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She plans to create a web application named "HuanFitnessPal," aligned with SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. The application will enable members to track their body weight, water consumption, and exercise routines, assisting them in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As she lacks the expertise to develop the application, she has hired your team to assist in this endeavor.

You are required to form a team of 5-6 people to develop a web application. Your team will collaborate to ensure the application is user-friendly and meets the required features.
    • Registration and Login Functions: Users can register for an account. Registered users can log in to access the application’s features.
    • Body Weight/Exercise/Water Consumption Data Management: Users can search for, view, add, update, and delete information related to their body weight, exercise routines, and water consumption.
    • Request to Meet Nutritionist: Users can send a request to meet with the nutritionist, specifying their preferred date and time.
    • Admin Features: Admins can view, search, add, edit, and delete user requests. 
    • User-Friendly Interface: The website will have an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interaction for all users.
